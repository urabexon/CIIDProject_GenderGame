# CIIDProject_GenderGame 🧑‍🤝‍🧑

This project is one of CIID's projects.<br>
It is an interactive experience designed to raise awareness and spark reflection on **gender perception** and **unconscious bias**.

## About This Game 🧩

This game allows you to visually and emotionally explore how you instinctively perceive gender. <br>
By interacting with a series of images, you can reflect on your own assumptions and recognition patterns.

When an image appears, follow your gut feeling and press:

- `→` Right arrow: if you perceive the person as **male**  
- `←` Left arrow: if you perceive the person as **female**

There are no right or wrong answers.  
What matters is that you **become aware of how you interpret and judge what you see**.

## Purpose of This Game 🎯

- To experience **how ambiguous gender judgments based on visual cues can be**  
- To help uncover your own **tendencies and biases** regarding gender recognition  
- To prompt discussion and reflection on the **influence of stereotypes and visual impressions**,  
  and how they may lead to misjudgment or bias related to gender

The ultimate goal is to **foster imagination, dialogue, and self-awareness**.

## At the End of the Game 📊

After you've viewed all the images, a result screen will display:

- The total time spent (in minutes and seconds)  
- How many times you chose **male** (right key)  
- How many times you chose **female** (left key)

Take a moment to reflect on your choices.  
If possible, discuss your reasoning with others who have played the game —  
**What influenced your decision? Why did you feel that way?**

## About CIID & Human-Centered Design 🧠

This is an experiential project at CIID (Copenhagen Institute of Interaction Design) on self-reflection through action, cognition and design.

### What is CIID? ▶️

CIID is a world-renowned design education institute based in Copenhagen, Denmark.  
It connects **technology, design, and social impact**, and fosters **project-based learning** that encourages creative individuals from around the world to tackle real-world challenges through design.

### What is Human-Centered Design (HCD)? 👥

At the heart of CIID’s philosophy is **Human-Centered Design** —  
a design approach that emphasizes **empathy, observation, and iterative experimentation**  
to create experiences that are truly meaningful for people.

**Gender Game** embodies this approach by shifting focus away from right or wrong,  
and instead helping players **gain insight into their own judgments and perceptions**.

## Important Notes 📌

- This game is **not a scientific diagnostic tool**.  
- While it uses a binary gender input system (male/female), it **does not deny or invalidate the existence of non-binary or diverse gender identities**.  
- The goal is to encourage reflection on your internal processes when making judgments based on appearance.

## Sample Reflection Questions 💬

- Why did you judge “male/female” for that image or person?
- Were there any images that felt ambiguous? Why?
- Could your cultural background have influenced your judgment?
